# Rock-Paper-and-Scissor-Game
I created an interactive Rock, Paper, and Scissors game that allows users to play against the computer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The Rock, Paper, and Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two people. In this project, we recreate it digitally using web technologies.
